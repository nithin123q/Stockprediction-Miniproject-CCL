Abstract:

In Stock Market Prediction, the aim is to predict the future values of the financial stocks
of a company. As per efficient market theory when all information related to a company
and stock market event share instantly available to all stakeholders then the effects of
those event share ready embed themselves in the stock price. So it is said that only the
historical spot price carries the impact of all the other market events and can be
employed to predict its future movement The recent trend in stock market prediction
technologies is the use of machine learning which makes predictions based on the values
of current stock market indices by training on their previous values and deploy it on
cloud using stramlit. Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy
to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data
science
learning to predict stock values . Factors considered are open, close low, high and
volume. The prediction of a stock market direction may serve as early recommendation
system for short term investors and as early financial distress warning system for long
term shareholders. This paper aims to build a deep learning short term memory model(LSTM) to
achieve better prediction of stock market trends using correlated STI. This model is
implemented in python using powerful deep learning tensor flow. We achieved mean
prediction accuracy over number of stock datasets which is much higher than benchmark
approaches. The prediction accuracy indicates that the proposed model with combination
of technical analysis can provide often better results than the model build with
benchmark ML algorithms. The stock data is usually non stationary and attributes are
non correlative to each other. Several traditional stock technical indicators may
incorrectly predict the stock market trends







Conclusion:

• In this project, we tried to develop a prediction model for the stock market based on the
technical analysis using LSTM stock market data.
• LSTM model are very powerful in sequence prediction problems because they are able to store
past information.
• This could guide the future investors in the stock market to make profitable investment
decisions whether to buy or sell or hold a share.
• Stock markets are hard to monitor and require plenty of context when try to interpret the
movement and predict prices.
• They are able to keep track of context specific temporal dependencies between stock prices for
a longer period of time while performing predictions
